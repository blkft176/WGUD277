    <h2> Other information</h2>
   <p>
    Bozeman, Montana, nestled in the southwestern part of the state, 
    has a rich history rooted in both Native American heritage and 
    European settlement. Indigenous tribes like the Shoshone, Crow, and Salish 
    once inhabited the area, relying on its resources for survival. European-American 
    settlers arrived in the 1800s, leading to conflicts over land and resources. 
    Some Native American tribes were assigned reservation lands. Today, Bozeman 
    maintains a Native American presence and strives to honor and preserve 
    indigenous cultures through cultural events and educational programs. 
    This history is a significant part of Bozeman's cultural identity.
