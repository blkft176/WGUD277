    <h2> Other information</h2>
    <p>
    Missoula, Montana, has a diverse history rooted in both Native American
    heritage and European settlement. Before European arrival, the area 
    was inhabited by tribes like the Salish and Kootenai. The Lewis and
    Clark Expedition encountered local Native American groups in 1805. 
    European settlement, driven by factors like the Montana Gold Rush, 
    led to conflicts and the displacement of indigenous populations. Some 
    tribes were assigned reservation lands. Today, Missoula maintains a 
    Native American presence, with efforts to honor and preserve indigenous 
    cultures. This history is an integral part of the city's identity.
