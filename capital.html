   <p>
    Helena, Montana, has a rich Native American history. Before European settlement, 
    various tribes, including the Salish, Shoshone, Blackfeet, Nez Perce, and Crow, 
    inhabited the region. The Montana Gold Rush had a significant impact on indigenous 
    communities, leading to conflicts and displacement. Treaties created reservations, 
    such as the Blackfeet and Crow Reservations. Today, efforts are made to preserve 
    and celebrate Native American cultures in the area, with spiritual and cultural 
    significance still attached to the land. For a more detailed understanding, 
    consult local sources and tribal representatives.
